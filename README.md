# Exploring Interaction Effects in Linear Regression: A Simulation Study

This project explores how interaction and polynomial terms affect linear regression modeling using a simulated dataset. The study highlights how including higher-order terms influences predictor coefficients and overall model fit. The dataset is generated within the notebook, so no external data is required.

## Project Structure

- `ols_interaction_analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with code, explanations, and results.
- `ols_interaction_analysis.html` — Exported HTML version of the notebook.
- `ols_interaction_analysis.pdf` — Exported PDF version of the notebook.
- `figures/` — Contains exported plots mainly for reference; all figures are already embedded in the outputs.

## Key Points

- Simulated dataset with continuous predictors.
- Linear regression models with and without interaction and polynomial terms.
- Comparison of model coefficients and overall fit metrics.
- Visualization of regression surfaces and interaction effects.

## Requirements

- Python (3.10.16 recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
- Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `ISLP`

You can install the required packages with: 
```{bash}
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels ISLP
```

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `ols_interaction_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run all cells to reproduce results, figures, and exported HTML/PDF outputs.
