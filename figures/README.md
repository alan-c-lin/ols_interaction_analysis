# Figures

This folder contains exported plots from the `ols_interaction_analysis` project for easy reference: 

- `figure1_x1_histogram.png` — Histogram of the first simulated independent variable (`x1`), drawn from a uniform distribution.
- `figure2_x2_histogram.png` — Histogram of the second simulated independent variable (`x2`), drawn from a beta distribution.
- `figure3_noise_histogram.png` — Histogram of the simulated random noise, drawn from a normal distribution.
- `figure4_y_histogram.png` — Histogram of the response variable (`y`), calculated using the true underlying function with noise included.

Distribution parameters and the true function used to generate `y` are detailed in the notebook. All plots are also embedded in the Jupyter Notebook outputs (`.ipynb`, `.html`, and `.pdf`).
